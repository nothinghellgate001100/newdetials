    <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>1) Can only the supervisor invite someone, or can the customer also invite?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Both can invite someone.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>2) Can a user register using an invitation code only, or will there also be a link for registration?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Yes, users need an invitation code for registration. You can create a link with the invitation code for easy registration. When someone clicks on the invitation link, they will see a form with the invitation code already filled in.

      <strong>3) Will a supervisor have only one invitation code associated with them?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      I want 10 supervisor accounts, each with a unique invitation code. Supervisors can invite users, and these users will be displayed in their respective accounts. If a user invites a new member, the new member will appear in the supervisor's account who invited the first person.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>4) When a user deposits, will it be liquid money using a payment gateway or just simple numbers?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      There is no need for a payment gateway. Supervisors and admins will handle this manually. If someone sends money to the deposit wallet address, they need to send a screenshot of the payment to customer service via Telegram for verification. Once verified, the account's deposit money will increase. This deposit amount will be used to display order packages, etc.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>5) When a user withdraws, how will it be managed? Will a specific amount be sent to their bank account or just points added?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Users will submit their wallet address and withdrawal password in the wallet management section. When applying for withdrawal, they will enter the amount they want to withdraw and their withdrawal password. If all information is correct, the supervisor will receive a message with the user's details and send the amount manually to the submitted wallet address. If the user hasn't submitted 20 orders, they cannot apply for withdrawal, and pending orders will be displayed.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>6) Please explain clearly about orders. Will they be like eCommerce orders or something else?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Orders will follow a unique scheme. The website will have three sections: Amazon, Alibaba, and AliExpress, each with 10 different schemes. There will be 20 orders in Alibaba, 15 orders in AliExpress, and 25 orders in Amazon, with additional lucky orders. Each scheme will have a specific pattern, and I will provide a link soon to demonstrate how it works.

      <strong>Profile</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      I want changes in the profile section. Currently, it shows too much information. I only want to display the account amount, deposited money, pending money, today's commission, and pending orders. If you have any more questions, please let me know, and I will explain further.
